# Object Detection Challenge. 

This is the repository for the Imagenet object detection challenge hosted on Kaggle. 
Right now there is no time limit to solve the challenge. It is still in a soft launch phase. 

We will take it slow and use the time to work a bit on the basics. These would include answering questions like: 

1. How to work with videos in Python? 
2. What libraries are there to do this in Python? 
3. How to do basic object recognition from videos?
