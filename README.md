# Object Detection Challenge. 

This is the repository for the Imagenet object detection challenge hosted on Kaggle. 
Right now there is no time limit to solve the challenge. It is still in a soft launch phase. 

We will take it slow and use the time to work a bit on the basics. These would include answering questions like: 

1. How to work with videos in Python? 
2. What libraries are there to do this in Python? 
3. How to do basic object recognition from videos? 


## Resources to get started: 
Please update this section as and when new and interesting materials are found. 

### Papers
1. Large Scale Video Classification with Convolution Neural Networks.

### Tutorials and online courses
1.CS-231n: CNN for Visual Recognition  http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html 

### Blogs
1. Motion tracking demo. Might not be useful.  http://derek.simkowiak.net/motion-tracking-with-python/


### To Do: 
1. 1. Install OpenCV 

2. Tutorials on openCV especially video analysis http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_video/py_table_of_contents_video/py_table_of_contents_video.html#py-table-of-content-video

3. Get the sports 1m dataset from the Andrej Karpathy paper and implement some of the concepts in the paper.
